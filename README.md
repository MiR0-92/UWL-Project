NOTE: I did not create this game!
I have merely added on to the existing game and AI framework.
Major props to Shaun Williams for recreating the entire suite of Pac-Man games and CalvinJC for creating this Smart Pac-Man AI, as well as great practice tools. Thank you for publishing your source code! I highly recommend everyone check out his page and play the game for yourself at http://pacman.shaunew.com/ and http://pacman.calvinjc.com.
